# Simple expander
This is a template for and a showcase of the **Simple Expander** format.

## Usage

### Designers / users
The template is meant to be ready-made. 
- Download and use the `dist/` folder from this repository.  
- Use the `index.html` file as the starting point.
- Feel free to add, remove and rearrange any content inside the `index.html` file.
- The template includes *reusable components* (see [components](#components)). Delete all unused *components* and all its dependencies (css, js).
- Images (and other assets) can be placed inside the `assets/` directory. The `assets/expander/` dir contains assets for the aforementioned components - don't delete these if you plan to use any of the components.
- Any custom styling can be added inside the `css/style.css` file.
- Similarly any custom scripting can be added inside the `js/script.js`.

### Developers
For development of the template a [SCSS preprocessor](https://sass-lang.com/) is being used. All the JavaScript components are written in plain JS as of now.

The compilation of the ready-made template is being done by *Node scripts*. Please see the `package.json` file.

## Components

The components are entities that are being used repetitively in the expanders. Things like video players (almost always), sliders, carousels etc.

These pre-coded elements are prepared to be easily used and adapted. More advanced adjustment is also possible but requires some knowledge of JavaScript.

Some of the components rely on third-party scripts and libraries that need to be included in order to function properly.
